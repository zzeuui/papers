## Towards Open World Object Detection (2021)

### ðŸ’¡Problem
â€˜Open World Object Detectionâ€™
1) identify objects that have not been introduced to it as â€˜unknownâ€™, without explicit supervision to do so, and
2) incrementally learn these identified unknown categories without forgetting previously learned classes,
when the corresponding labels are progressively received. 

### ðŸ’¡Motivation  
Open-set Learning + Incremental Learning + Detection

### ðŸ’¡Method
- Faster RCNN: detect interest region, auto-labelling unknowns with RPN
- Contrastive Clustering: To learn more discriminative representation for each class
- Energy based unknown identifier: estimates the compatibility between observed variables feature and possible set of output variables labels using a single output scalar.
- Alleviating Forgetting: for Incremental Learning
